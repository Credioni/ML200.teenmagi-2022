# teenmagi-2022

Kaggle competition - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/teenmagi-2022
This dataset is artificially generated. It is large in the sense that there is one million images and one thousand classes. The dataset is however conveniently small in the sense that "images" are only eight times eight pixels and single channel (gray level).
The dataset was made for the Tampere University DATA.ML.200 Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning course students, but also others can submit their results.
